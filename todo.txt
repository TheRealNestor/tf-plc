- Create a working tensorflow model in python (which we can use as example)

- Verify that new refactor still works

- Add Conv layers
- Add dropout layers
- Quantize/Dequantize layers (I think values for this are already accessible statically in the IR, probably a simple calculation to add this)

- Figure out a way to reuse variables in ST code to reduce memory footprint. I don't think there is a garbage collector or anything of the sort....
