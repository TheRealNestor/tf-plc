- dont hardcode real type everywhere in code gen, particularly when quantizing and seemingly scaling. What is the saturation?
- ONNX: inputs like const_fold_opt_36. How to handle these?
- Add Conv layers
- Add dropout layers
- Quantize/Dequantize layers (I think values for this are already accessible statically in the IR, probably a simple calculation to add this)
- Figure out a way to reuse variables in ST code to reduce memory footprint. I don't think there is a garbage collector or anything of the sort....
- Update readme.md 
- Figure out how to access the temperature sensor on the HW. 
- Simpler way to use StratonPLC?
