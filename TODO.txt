- Add Conv layers
- Figure out a way to reuse variables in ST code to reduce memory footprint. I don't think there is a garbage collector or anything of the sort....
- Figure out how to access the temperature sensor on the HW. 
- Simpler way to use StratonPLC? 
- Record real sensor readings, including time and conditions behind the data. 


- Add memory check (emit warning or fail when exceeding static memory limits)
