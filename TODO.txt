- Add Conv layers
- Add dropout layers
- Quantize/Dequantize layers (I think values for this are already accessible statically in the IR, probably a simple calculation to add this)
- Figure out a way to reuse variables in ST code to reduce memory footprint. I don't think there is a garbage collector or anything of the sort....
- Figure out how to access the temperature sensor on the HW. 
- Simpler way to use StratonPLC? 


- Record real sensor readings, including time and conditions behind the data. 
- SHA holiday from 10/12 
- Get feedback on report early...
- Contribution table at the end of the report (both report and engineering work) [also do this early, december-early]


- By next week-ish send draft of report and contributions
