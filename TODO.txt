- Add Conv layers
- Figure out how to access the temperature sensor on the HW. 
- Record real sensor readings, including time and conditions behind the data. 

- Add memory check (emit warning or fail when exceeding static memory limits)


- Refactor generator.py (modularize code, split into multiple files)
