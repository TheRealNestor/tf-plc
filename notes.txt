Shape (and Type) Inference
Knowing the shapes of results is not necessary to execute an ONNX graph but this information can be used to make it faster. If you have the following graph:

Add(x, y) -> z
Abs(z) -> w
If x and y have the same shape, then z and w also have the same shape. Knowing that, it is possible to reuse the buffer allocated for z, to compute the absolute value w inplace. Shape inference helps the runtime to manage the memory and therefore to be more efficient.
